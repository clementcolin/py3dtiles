### Intallation note : 

- To install [IfcOpenShell](http://ifcopenshell.org/)
    - Download the archive of the binary [here](http://ifcopenshell.org/python)
    - Use the following command to find the site-packages folder of your Python distribution ```python -m site --user-site```
    - Place it the extracted archive


### Running the IfcTiler

```
(venv) python Tilers/IfcTiles/IfcTiler.py  $PATH
```
$PATH should point to a directory holding an IFC file. 
The resulting 3DTiles tileset will contain the ifc geometry, ordered by category :
each tile will contain an IFC Object Type, that can be found in the batch table, along with its GUID 

This command should produce a directory named "ifc_tileset".


### About the tiler : 

- Projection system conversion using Pyproj : 
    - Actually "EPSG:27562" to "EPSG:3946" to support our test
    - Needs to be used in CL

- Scale change of the geometry : 
    - Actually, we can change from centimeter to meter
    - Needs to be used or not in CL
    - Needs to accept more units

- Support only IFC4 :
    - needs to support IFC2XC3 : 
            - test the file version
            - change the geometry access 

- Support the following geometry types, ignore other types : 
    - MappedRepresentation
    - Tesselation : desribe triangles and vertex in a classic way, they are used without modification
    - SweptSolid : describe a 2D area that needs to be extruded, using a direction. 
        - Method used
            - To triangulate this type of geometry, first we triangulate the 2d area, using its center as a new vertex
            - Then we create another 2D area, using the extrusion information, triangulate with the same method.
            - Finally, the 2 area are linked with triangle between each "same" vertex (if there was no extrusion)
        - Needs and drawback :
            - Currently supports only OuterCurver 2D point list for the 2D area
            - The triangulation will not support hole in the 2D area
            - The triangulation may not be optimal 

- All object position are relative to the site position (the higher node in the hierarchy ifc file). The position of the site is put in the transform field of the tileset.json of the generated 3DTiles, meaning that we can easily change the IFC position directly in the tileset.json file.

### Notes :

Existing possible solutions for a few needs  
#### To use CSG representation type 

[IfcCSGSolid](https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4/ADD1/HTML/schema/ifcgeometricmodelresource/lexical/ifccsgsolid.htm) : Boolean results of operations between solid models, half spaces and Boolean results

Use [Trimesh](https://trimsh.org/index.html) to create [parametrable primitives](https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4/ADD1/HTML/schema/ifcgeometricmodelresource/lexical/ifccsgprimitive3d.htm) 

```
mesh1 = shapely.geometry.box(minx, miny, maxx, maxy, ccw=True) 
mesh2 = trimesh.creation.cylinder(2,5)
trimesh.boolean.difference([mesh1,mes5h2],"scad")
```


#### To extrude triangulated polygones : 

Use [Trimesh](https://trimsh.org/index.html)

Transform the geometry into trimesh structure and then use :  
```trimesh.creation.extrude_triangulation()```

#### To triangulate and extrud polygones :

Use [Trimesh](https://trimsh.org/index.html) and [OpenScad](https://openscad.org/) and [Shapely](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/)
 
- needs the [Triangle](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html) library (needs C++ 14+ and Visual Studio Installer) and the [python wrapper](https://pypi.org/project/triangle/) 
- needs the mapbox_earcut library and Cmake

```
exterior = [(0, 0), (0, 20), (20, 20), (20, 0), (0, 0)]
interior = [(10, 0), (5, 5), (10, 10), (15, 5), (10, 0)][::-1]
polygon = Polygon(exterior, [interior])
trimesh.creation.extrude_polygon(polygon,50)
```
